A Scientific Calculator:
To run the program, please open the .exe file / the application.

Running the program in an IDE, type ".\TurnOnCalculator" to run the .exe file.

If a change is made in the code, type "make" in the terminal to re-compile the files together
and create a new TurnOnCalculator.exe file that uses the new updated code.

If a new file is added, add that file name to the Makefile to compile it alongside the others
when "make" is typed on the terminal.
